Concurency:
    Processes drop the CPU core that it is using when it is in a "waiting state".
        - this is in contrast to serial processes that lock the CPU while it is waiting for some type of response from human or application itself
    GoLang is concurent by default but also has specific things built into the language to set concurency items


Stronger that typical "multi threaded" languages
    GO Routine = is a set of methods that run in paralell on a single thread
